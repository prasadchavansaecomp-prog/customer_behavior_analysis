# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data to uncover
patterns in spending, product preferences, discounts, and subscription behavior.
The goal is to derive actionable business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

---

## 🧾 Dataset
- Total Records: 3,900 customer purchases
- Total Features: 18
- Data includes:
  - Customer demographics (age, gender, location, subscription status)
  - Purchase details (category, item, amount, season, size, color)
  - Shopping behavior (discounts, reviews, shipping type, purchase frequency)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard  
- **Excel**: Initial data review  

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning using Python  
2. Handling missing values and standardizing columns  
3. Feature engineering (age groups, customer segments)  
4. Loading cleaned data into PostgreSQL  
5. Business analysis using SQL queries  
6. Data visualization using Power BI

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Revenue comparison by gender  
- Subscriber vs non-subscriber spending behavior  
- Identification of high-spending discount users  
- Top-rated and most-purchased products  
- Shipping type impact on purchase amount  
- Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)  
- Revenue contribution by age group

## 📈 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of:
- Revenue by category and age group  
- Subscription distribution  
- Sales trends and customer segments  

*(Dashboard screenshots available in the images folder)*

## 💡 Key Insights
- Loyal customers form the largest customer segment  
- Subscription status does not significantly change average spend  
- Certain products are highly dependent on discounts  
- Young and middle-aged customers contribute the highest revenue  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Predictive modeling for customer churn  
- Product recommendation system  
- Automated data pipeline  
- Advanced customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis
